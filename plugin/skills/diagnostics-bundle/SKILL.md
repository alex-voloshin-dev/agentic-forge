description: Package this repo's agentic-forge diagnostics (the audit + diagnostics logs, environment, and plugin/config metadata) into ONE redacted, consistently-named zip in ~/Downloads, covering the last 7 days (or a user-given window), to share with a maintainer. Manual utility — run it when asked to collect / package / export the plugin diagnostics or "bundle up what the plugin did".

# Diagnostics bundle

Package the plugin's own diagnostics for the current repo into a single redacted zip that a
maintainer can analyze — the audit trail, the diagnostics log, an environment snapshot, and the
plugin/config metadata, plus a generated `README.md` and `log-summary.txt`. A thin wrapper over the
tested `agentic_forge.diag_bundle` lib (ADR 0052/0053).

## When to use

When asked to collect, package, export, or share the agentic-forge diagnostics for debugging the
plugin. Not for reading a single log in place (use `dev/audit_digest.py` / `dev/diagnostics_digest.py`)
and not for the plugin's own SDLC work.

## Steps

1. Pick the window: default **7 days**; use the number the user gave (e.g. "last 30 days" → 30).
   Full history is `--days 0`.
2. Run the shipped packager from the repo you want to bundle (default: current directory):

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/diagnostics-bundle/scripts/build_bundle.py" --days 7
   ```

   Add `--repo /path/to/repo` to bundle a different repo. It writes strictly to
   `~/Downloads/agentic-forge-diagnostics-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.zip` (UTC stamp) and prints the path.
3. Report the absolute output path, the covered window, and the audit/diagnostics counts from the
   command output. The bundle is already redacted — logs are hook-redacted at write time and the
   config/settings slices are re-redacted (the settings slice keeps only enablement + hooks, never
   tokens), so it is safe to share.

## Notes

- Consistent by contract: same filename shape and same internal layout every run, so bundles sort
  by time and are easy to find in `~/Downloads`.
- The window filters records by timestamp; records that predate audit timestamps (legacy) are
  retained rather than silently dropped.
- Details of the manifest, redaction, and windowing live in the lib and its tests
  (`tests/test_diag_bundle.py`); see `docs/architecture/scheduling-observability.md`.
